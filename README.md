How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    Ensuring code, program, or software is functional and secure takes a lot of work. A lot more than I had anticipated. So, I can ensure my code is secure and functional by sticking to the requirements and by writing heavy tests that provide a high coverage percentage when the code is tested. This can involve a little trial and error to see how much coverage the tests are.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
     I interpret user needs by reading the expectations/requirements. Then, I will try to optimize their needs based on the contriants of set program whether it is budget, timeline, etc. More importantly, this is not something that should be looked at once, it needs to be consistently looked at when developing the program to ensure nothing is missed.

How do I approach designing software?
    I believe this answer also depends on the program that is being developed. Sometime there is different ways to approach each software when it comes to design. Nonetheless, there are some cruicial items I believe that need to be taken like fully understanding what the program needs to be before jumping into design.
